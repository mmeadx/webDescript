# Web Description Character Count App


_While working with Almanac, the producer had mentioned that his least favorite part of his job was writing the web descriptions for the show because of the character limit. I created this to help him know exactly how close he was to his limit on each type of descriptor._


_This is a very simple front end app created using JavaScript_
